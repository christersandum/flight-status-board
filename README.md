## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No flights showing:**
- Check if OpenSky API is accessible
- Try different airport/time of day
- Verify bounding box coordinates are correct

**API timeout:**
- OpenSky API may be slow or rate-limited
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Consider implementing caching

**Port already in use:**
- Change PORT environment variable
- Kill process using port 8080
